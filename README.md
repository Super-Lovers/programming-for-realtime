# Super Mario Bros - NES version prototype assignment

## Description

This is a Super Mario Bros - NES prototype and only includes the first world's level (1-1). You begin the game by pressing *space* and when the timer reaches 0 you lose. The goal is to reach the end of the level without being defeated by hostiles or falling down the level from pits while gaining as much points as possible.

## Graphics used in the game

The tiles for the map and the interactive graphics that I've used for the whole game can be found at https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/supermariobros/
